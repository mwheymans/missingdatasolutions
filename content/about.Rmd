My name is Martijn Heymans. I am an Associate Professor at the department of 
Epidemiology and Biostatistics of the Amsterdam University Medical Center 
(Amsterdam UMC), The Netherlands. 

My main topics of interest are Missing Data, Clinical Prediction Modeling,
and Machine Learning. My work consists of supervising PhD projects on 
methodological and clinical topics, lecturing courses and statistical consultancy. 

I like to work with RStudio and try to provide solutions for applied clinical 
researchers. I have a background in Physical Therapy, Human Movement Sciences, 
Epidemiology and Medical Biostatistics.
