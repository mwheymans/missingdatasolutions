On this page you will find information about modern Missing Data Methods.

## Regression models
I have written an R package that is called [psfmi](/psfmi/), which
means "Predictor Selection Functions in Multiply Imputed Datasets"

## Missing Data websites
You may visit the Website of [Iris Eekhout](https://www.iriseekhout.com/){target="_blank"}, 
who wrote her PhD on missing data in questionaire data. She compared missing 
data methods for questionnaire missing items and total scores. 
I supervised that project.

You may visit the Website of Stef van Buuren, the developer of Multiple Imputation with
Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE),
nowadays also implemented in software pacakges as SPSS.
